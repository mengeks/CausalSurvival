### Model: Fixed Treatment Cox
df_bwh_fixed <- df_bwh_timevar %>%
  mutate(age = scale(age),
         year = scale(year))

fit_fixed <- 
  coxph(Surv(futime, fustat) ~ age + surgery + year + trt, 
        data = df_bwh_fixed, 
        ties = "breslow")
summary(fit_fixed)
# \xmeng{ it's not working: all results are NA }
# Inspection: Inspected all regressors by taking table of the 
# binary variables and histogram of the continuous variables
# Found two things: 1. fustat is zero for all 881 patients (the most likely reason)
table(df_bwh_fixed$fustat)
# 2. trt is 1 for 878 out of 881 patients (the less likely reason)
table(df_bwh_fixed$trt)

# First attempt: remove filter(transplant == TRUE) in construction of df_bwh_timevar
# it did not work because it indeed get some ones 
# fustat now has 1148 zeros out of 1221 rows

## How to make the model work?
## Answer: when we remove filter(transplant == TRUE) AND we remove the trt variable
## Notice that after removing the filter, the trt variable has 340 NA entries
sum(is.na(df_bwh_fixed$age)) # == 340

## but even we remove the trt variable, if the filter is not removed, then it still will fail
## so the primary criterion is that we need to make the fustat variable contains enought 0 and 1.
## and the secondary criterion is that we need to have non NA treatment variable
## so what values 

# So there is an issue that some rows of data has NA in trt -- is this expected?
# I feel a treatment variable could be:
# - 1 (obtained transplant)
# - 0 (confirmed no transplant, i.e., died)
# - NA (lost of follow up (including recovered right?) of the patient, 
#   and no transplant during the period of following up
#   because if we follow up means we know the death)
